🌊 Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project is part of my virtual internship at **CODSOFT**.
The goal is to predict the survival of Titanic passengers using Logistic Regression based on their characteristics such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

📁 Task Overview
✅ Dataset: Titanic Dataset (local CSV)
📐 Features used: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked
🧠 Model: Logistic Regression
🎯 Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived (Yes/No)

🧠 What I Learned

* Loading, cleaning, and exploring real-world datasets
* Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
* Visualizing data distributions and relationships with Seaborn and Matplotlib
* Building a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn
* Evaluating the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

📊 Model Performance

* Achieved decent accuracy on test data (\~78%-80%)
* Visualized results with a clear confusion matrix

📌 How to Run

1. Download the notebook and Titanic CSV
2. Open in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells
