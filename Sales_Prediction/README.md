📈 Sales Prediction using Simple Linear Regression
This project is part of my virtual internship at **CODSOFT**.
The goal is to predict product sales based on advertising spend using Simple Linear Regression.

📁 Task Overview
✅ Dataset: Advertising and Sales Dataset (local CSV)
📐 Feature used: TV Advertising Budget
🧠 Model: Simple Linear Regression
🎯 Goal: Predict future sales based on advertising spend

🧠 What I Learned

* Loading and exploring datasets using pandas
* Visualizing relationships between variables using seaborn and matplotlib
* Applying Simple Linear Regression to find correlations between features and target
* Evaluating the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R2 Score**
* Visualizing actual vs predicted values with regression lines

📊 Model Performance

* The model showed a strong positive relationship between TV advertising and sales
* Achieved a good R2 score indicating that advertising spend is a useful predictor of sales

📌 How to Run

1. Download the notebook and the CSV dataset
2. Open in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**
3. Run all cells to view the results and visualizations
