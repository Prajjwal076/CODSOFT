## üìÇ Projects Completed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Titanic Survival Prediction üö¢

In this project, I built a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.

**What I Learned:**

* Data cleaning (handling missing values)
* Data preprocessing (encoding categorical variables)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn & Matplotlib
* Building and evaluating a classification model using **Logistic Regression**
* Interpreting **Accuracy**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **Classification Report**

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas, Numpy
* Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Prediction üìà

In this project, I developed a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict sales based on advertising spend (TV ads). I explored the relationship between investment in advertising and the resulting sales.

**What I Learned:**

* Visualizing relationships using scatter plots
* Applying Simple Linear Regression
* Calculating evaluation metrics like **Mean Squared Error** and **R2 Score**
* Plotting regression lines to visualize predictions vs actual outcomes

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

## üöÄ Key Takeaways from the Internship

* I learned how to approach **data-driven problem solving** using Python.
* I understood the importance of **data preprocessing** and how it affects model performance.
* I practiced **visualizing data** to gain insights and effectively communicate results.
* I built confidence in using **machine learning models** for both classification and regression problems.

## üìå How to Run These Projects

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have **Jupyter Notebook** installed (or use **Google Colab**).
3. Place the provided datasets (`Iris.csv`, `Titanic-Dataset.csv`, `sales.csv`) in the same folder as the notebooks.
4. Open each `.ipynb` file in Jupyter and run all cells to see the code, visualizations, and outputs.
